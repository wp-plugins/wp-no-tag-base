== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use this plugin? =

Use this plugin if you want to get rid of WordPress' "tag" base completely. The normal behaviour of WordPress is to add '/tag' to your tag permalinks if you leave "Tag base" blank in the Permalink settings. So your tag links look like `myblog.com/tag/my-tag/`. With this plugin your tag links will look like `myblog.com/my-tag/` (or `myblog.com/my-tag/` in case of sub categories).

Why do this?  Well, shorter URLs mean betting indexing and bottom line is: it's good for SEO.  Having the meaningless "tag" in your permalinks will dilute their keyword relevance.  Keep your tag permalinks tight with this plugin.
